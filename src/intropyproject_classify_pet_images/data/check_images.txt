Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No. The dog is a Golden Doodle. Resnet classified it as Miniature Poodle on both images. Alexnet classified both images as toy poodle. Vgg classified the original image as Kerry Blue Terrier and the flipped image as Miniature Poodle.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes for Resnet and Alexnet. However, Vgg classified the original image as Kerry Blue Terrier and the flipped image as Miniature Poodle.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, all three models distinguished dogs from other animal and object.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: I selected ResNet as the best model architecture. 

All three models correctly identified dogs vs. non-dogs with 100% accuracy. However, ResNet performed best in breed classification for the Golden Doodle images. A Golden Doodle is a cross between a Golden Retriever and a Poodle, so poodle-related classifications are the closest match since poodle is one of the parent breeds.

ResNet classified both Golden Doodle images as "miniature poodle," which is very close to the actual breed. AlexNet also classified both as "toy poodle," which is also close. VGG performed worst, classifying one image as "kerry blue terrier" (unrelated to Golden Doodles) and only one as "miniature poodle," showing inconsistency.

ResNet is the best choice because it correctly identified all dogs and non-dogs, provided accurate breed classifications (poodle variants closely related to Golden Doodles), and showed consistency across both Golden Doodle images.
